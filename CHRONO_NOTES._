NOTE: 2020_07_17: SOB (state_object_bundle)

    If we are just passing around "sob" as a single parameter
    to every function, it is easy to remember what parameters
    all functions take. But how do we remember what parts of
    "sob" are used?

        Idea   : Function name declares what part.
        Example: HN5_Pri_sob_ASA_cof_ros

        Means "Print sob" "as a" cof_ros ( [sob.cof,sob.ros] )

        For consistency, we can avoid things like:

            HN5_Pri_sob_USING_cof_ros
            HN5_ActionToPerform_sob_USING_cof_ros
            HN5_ActionToPerform_sob_MEMBERS_cof_ros

        The ASA "as a" can also be thought of as synonymous 
        with "using" or "members".

        See where this experiment leads us.
